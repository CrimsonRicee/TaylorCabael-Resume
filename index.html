        <p class="lead mb-4">I grew up in a family of engineers and health professionals. I loved the idea of science and the excitement of the feats my parents are and were able to achieve. However, I never felt like this was the proper course or road for me to pursue. I wanted to venture off and do something away from what I was expected to become. I wanted to try something new. Albeit, I did try health science. I was not the most successful through this endeavor. However, through some connections and some research, I realized that I could still pursue a career in health without focusing on the science aspect, but more on the business and productivity aspect of it all. <br><br>

        By opening my horizons to different approaches and different routes, I was able to find a path for myself that was entirely new and unexpectedly enticing. I am embarking on my own journey to learn new things about healthcare from the business side of things. I am going to enter this field with some understanding of how healthcare is run through the knowledge given to me by my parents and their own experiences being in their respective feilds for 20 plus years. As a child, my parents would bring me to work, whether it be because they can not leave me alone at home by myself or to show me their work, but this time with them has allowed me to become exposed to the field that interests me. Moreover, I have also been able to garner connections and recieve valuable advice from my parents' collegues as well.<br><br>

        I am currently a second-year university student attending the University of California, Riverside. As a worker, I have built experience as a manager and shift lead working at establishments such as Caffe-In and Starbucks. I plan to venture out and entire the healthcare scene one day and become a manager, project lead, or even an owner of an establishment ran by myself and a few other collegues in health science and law. As far-fetched as it may sound, I plan on utilizing my experience and understanding of the field to pursue my dream and my goals.
